            1. Avoid Installing Apps from Unknown Sources - unless you thoroughly researched the marketplace.
            
            2. Scrutinize App Permissions - always figure out which permissions each app requires and which ones they simply want
            
            3. Update Your Android version regularly - SEV (Security vulnerabilities) will always exist, but so will patches 
            
            4. Use Secure Connections - Avoid public Wi-Fi networks when possible, as they can be insecure
            
            5. Device Locking Mechanisms: Utilize a strong lock screen password or biometric lock to prevent unauthorized access
            
            6. Data Encryption: Enable data encryption on your device to protect your personal information 
            
            7. Manage Notifications: Disable notifications on the lock screen for apps that display sensitive information
            
            8. Implement Two-Factor Authentication: Use two-factor authentication for Google and other apps that offer it
